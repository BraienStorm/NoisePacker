**NoisePacker** is an experimental **asymmetric** compression concept that tries to squeeze *finite* chunks of **cryptographically strong random data** (e.g. `os.urandom`, encrypted blobs).  
Instead of finding patterns (ZIP/LZ/LZMA), it “mines” for **generators**: PRNG states (seeds) that statistically correlate with local fluctuations and let us reduce entropy *within a block*.

## ✨ Key ideas / features

- **Entropy mining:** brute-force search for PRNG seeds that produce a “useful” mask for a block.
- **Lazy Hunter:** adjacent optimal seeds often cluster → store **deltas** efficiently with variable-length coding.
- **Bitmap fallback:** 1 bit / block to mark **raw vs packed**, so the format stays robust when mining fails.
- **Asymmetric design:** **very slow compression** (mining) → **fast decompression** (generation + decode).

## 🧠 How it works (high level)

Conventional theory says **max-entropy streams** are incompressible — which is true in the limit of infinite data.  
For **finite blocks** (e.g. 512 bits), randomness still exhibits **local statistical fluctuations**. NoisePacker trades **compute time** for **a tiny probability of gain**.

### Pipeline

1. **Chunking**  
   Split data into fixed-size blocks (e.g. 512 bits).

2. **Seed mining (brute force)**  
   For each block, simulate many PRNG states (currently **Mersenne Twister**) and search for a generated bitstream that acts like a “good XOR mask” and reduces block entropy.

3. **Differential seed coding**  
   - Storing a full seed each time is too expensive (≈32 bits baseline).
   - Observation: nearby blocks often have nearby “good” seeds.
   - Store **Δ(seed)** using **variable-length coding**.

4. **Economic decision**  
   Compress a block only if:

   `entropy_gain > delta_cost + 1_bit_flag`

   Otherwise store the block raw.

## 📊 Example benchmark

Tested on **50 KB of `os.urandom`** (high-quality kernel entropy):

```text
--- NOISEPACKER BENCHMARK ---
Source: os.urandom (Cryptographic Entropy)
Size: 51200 bytes (266 chunks)
------------------------------------------------------------
...
#240   | ✅ COMP   | +1        | +0.0
#250   | ✅ COMP   | -5        | -0.9
#260   | ✅ COMP   | -2        | -0.5
------------------------------------------------------------
Execution Time: 1.51s
Chunks Compressed: 156 / 266 (58.6%)
------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL SIZE: 408576 bits
PACKED SIZE:   408519 bits
------------------------------------------------------------
🏆 SUCCESS! Reduced entropy by 57 bits.
   Compression Ratio: 0.0140%
```

0.014% is tiny — but achieving *any* positive result on true random data demonstrates the **finite-block anomaly exploitation** + **Lazy Hunter** approach.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a research experiment. Compression ratio depends heavily on luck (finding matching seeds within the search radius), parameters, and block size. It is **not** intended for critical data storage.
